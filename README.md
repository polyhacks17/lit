# lit
## What is this?
This is the folder with everything pertaining to the sign-in utility.

- lit.sh - lit itself
- polyhacks.png - the screensaver that was put on the Kindles

## Why did you choose this name for this project?
Well, we wanted our sign-in process to be pretty lit. Mission accomplished.

## How do I make it work with my event?
Just replace the placeholder entries in lit.sh with actual values. A proper write-up will come eventually.
